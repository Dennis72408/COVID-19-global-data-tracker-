COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A Python-based data analysis project that explores global COVID-19 data to uncover patterns, visualize trends, and provide insights into the pandemic's global impact. The project processes real-world data and presents findings through visualizations and summary statistics.

---

## Objectives

- Collect and clean COVID-19 data from reliable sources.
- Analyze global trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Visualize data to make patterns and outliers more understandable.
- Compare country-level responses and results.
- Practice data analysis and visualization skills using Python.

---

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas – data manipulation
- NumPy – numerical operations
- Matplotlib – static plots
- Seaborn – statistical visualizations
- Plotly – interactive charts
- Requests – fetching data from URLs
- JSON – data parsing

## Insights and Reflections

- **Trend Observation**: Countries that started vaccination early and maintained consistent measures showed noticeable drops in death rates.
- **Challenges**: Missing or delayed updates in datasets required interpolation and data cleaning.
- **Skills Gained**: Working on this project strengthened my skills in:
- Data wrangling and merging multiple datasets.
- Creating both static and interactive plots.
- Drawing actionable insights from real-world health data.
